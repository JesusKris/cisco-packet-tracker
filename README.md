## General Information
This project was made as a school project in [kood/JÃµhvi](https://kood.tech/) (12.6.2023)

The project required me to complete [8 sub exercises](./assets/solutions/) each requiring a construction of a network and understanding of different theoretical/practical points using [Cisco Packet Tracker](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer).

**NB! Different source control platform was used hence no commit history.**
